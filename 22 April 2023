Left Rotate an array by k positions: Easy
Reverse entire array and reverse inner arrays by index

> 3 Sum: Hard
1.Sort the array
2.Inside a for loop put two pointers for y (j) and z (k), while x (i) is handled by the loop itself
3.i from 0, j from i + 1 position and k from n - 1 
4.sum = x + y + z
5.If equal to target, add to list s
6.If sum < 0: j++
7.Else k--
8.Return array
Eg: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
